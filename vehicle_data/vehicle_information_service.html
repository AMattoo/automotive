    <!-- Abstract -->
    <section id="abstract">
	<p>The W3C Vehicle Signal Server Specification defines a WebSocket based API that enables
	client applications to get, set, subscribe and unsubscribe to vehicle signals and data.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this specification is to promote a Server API that enables application 
	development in a consistent manner across participating automotive manufacturers.</p>

	<p>It is recommended that this Vehicle Signal Server Specification is read in conjunction with the W3C Vehicle Signal 
	Client Specification and the GENIVI Vehicle Signal Specification.</p>
	
	</p>The Vehicle Signal Client Specification defines an API that wraps the data access and security primitives
	defined in this WebSocket Server Specification. It has been defined to support the development
	of 'standards-compliant' JavaScript libraries that can be used by web based clients.</p> 

	<p>It is assumed that native clients (written for example in C/C++) and managed runtime clients 
	(written in languages like Java or C#) will invoke the WebSocket Server API using standard WebSocket
	libraries that have been created specifically for those languages.</p>

	<p>The GENIVI Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) defines the set of vehicle signals and data that 
	are exposed via this Server Specification. The term 'signal' is used here to represent an item of
	data that can vary over time, for example vehicle speed, whilst the term 'static data' is used to
	denote a temporally unchanging property like vehicle width.</p>

	<p>This Server Specification describes a discovery mechanism that defines the set of signals and data
	that a particular client can access at a particular point in time. It is recognized that some automobile
	manufacturers may expose more signals and data than others. The Vehicle Signal Specification supports both
	extensibility and the ability to define private branches.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, the 'tree' of signals that is accessible at any point in time may also vary depending
	on standard access control principles. That is, it can vary based on the identity of the user (person or
	organisation) requesting the data and/or the device (e.g. vehicle) where the request originates.</p>

	<p>To support this, the Server Specification describes a token based mechanism that can optionally
	be used to pass tokens to the WebSocket Server to represent the user of an application and the device that
	the application is running on.</p>

	<p>The target platform supported by the specification is exclusively passenger vehicles. Use of this 
	specification for non-passenger applications (transportation, heavy machinery, marine, airline 
	infotainment, military, etc.) is not prohibited, but is not covered in the design or content of the
	API and therefore may be insufficient.</p>

	<p>Initially, a typical use case of Vehicle Information might be the implementation of a 'Smart Mechanic'
	application that provides vehicle status information such as tire pressure, engine oil level, washer
	fluid level, battery status, etc. Future use case innovations in transportation, safety, navigation, 
	smart energy grid and consumer infotainment and customization are all possible through this specification.</p>

	<p>Web developers building interoperable applications based upon this API, will help empower a common web platform
	across consumer devices and passenger vehicles consistent with the Web of Things.</p>

    <!-- Status of this document -->
    <section id="sotd">
    </section>
    
    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The vehicle will expose vehicle signals via a WebSocket. This will
      enable a client to GET or SET vehicle signals; to SUBSCRIBE to receive
      notifications relating to one or more vehicle signals and later to UNSUBSCRIBE
      from receiving notifications.</p>
      
      <p>A future revision of this specification may consider additionally exposing vehicle signals
      via a RESTful web service but this is out of scope for this version of the specification.</p>
      
      <p>The W3C WebSocket API is defined <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-websockets-20110929">here</a> and 
      the WebSocket Protocol is defined in 
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC6455</a>.</p>
      
      <p>A component or module running on the vehicle is required to open
      a WebSocket connection to enable secure access to vehicle signals. 
      In this specification this module will be referred to as the ‘Application 
      Server’ or for simplicity as the ‘Server’.</p>
      
      <p>This specification assumes that a single WebSocket is used to
      enable communication between the client Application and the server
      in order to reduce processing overhead.</p>
      
      <p>N.B It is not explicitly prohibited for the client to request
      that the server opens more than one WebSocket. However, the server
      may refuse to open a subsequent connection and the client is
      responsible for handling this gracefully.</p>

      <p>If more than one WebSocket connection is established between a
      client Application and the server then each connection will be
      managed independently. For example, subscriptions created using a
      particular WebSocket connection will only trigger notifications via
      that connection and the client must use that WebSocket instance to
      unsubscribe.</p>

      <p>N.B. If more than one WebSocket connection has been established
      between one or more clients and a particular server instance, there
      is a risk that race conditions and concurrency issues could occur,
      for example when two or more WebSocket connections are used to
      concurrently update (SET) the same value.</p>
      
      <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the client can only assume
      that the server will implement a simple concurrency model where lost
      updates and dirty reads could potentially occur if the server has
      more than one WebSocket connection open.</p>
      <p>

      <!-- Initialisation of the Web Socket -->
      <section>
	<h3><a>Initialisation</a> of the Web Socket</h3>
	
	<p>If the client application is an HTML Application running in a web
	runtime or is a web page running in a browser, the WebSocket
	instance can either be initialised natively or created using a
	WebSocket standards compliant JavaScript library. A WebSocket
	request can also be initiated from a native (e.g. C++) Application
	or from an Application written using a managed runtime language like
	Java or C#. It is assumed that native and managed clients will use a
	suitable standards compliant WebSocket library to request that a
	WebSocket connection is opened on the server.</p>

	<p>For browser and web runtime clients, the advantage of
	initialising the WebSocket natively in the web runtime is that there
	are fewer overheads for the vehicle signal implementation.</p>
	
	<p>A client running on the vehicle will be able to connect to the
	Application Server instance using the hostname 'wwwivi' and will
	default to port 443. 'wwwivi' would be mapped to 127.0.0.1 in
	etc/hosts file.</p>
	
	<p>The sub-protocol name will always be VISS and with a version
	number suffix, e.g. VISS1.0</p>

	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> vehicle  = new WebSocket("wss://wwwivi", "<sub-protocol>");
	</pre>
	
	<p>RESTful web services are out of scope for the first revision of
	this specification, but could be considered for addition in a later
	version.</p>
	
	<p>There is little advantage to embedding this in a Vehicle object
	on the navigator interface.</p>

	<p>To support ‘defence in depth’ and a layered security approach,
	connections between clients and servers will be strongly
	encrypted. This is to make it more difficult for an attacker that
	has succeeded in installing malicious code on a vehicle to
	eavesdrop, hijack security tokens and impersonate valid security
	principals to get and set sensitive vehicle signals.</p>
	
	<p>The client will connect to the server over HTTPS and request that
	the server opens a WebSocket. All WebSocket communications between
	the client and server will therefore be over ‘wss’.</p>
	
	<p>Non encrypted communication will not be supported, hence the
	server will refuse ‘ws’ connection requests.</p>

	<p>In many vehicle designs, vehicle signals are made available by
	Electronic Control Units (ECUs) connected via internal vehicle
	networks. These include Controller Area Networks (CAN), Media
	Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) and Local Interconnect Networks
	(LIN). For security reasons, clients will not be able to connect
	directly to ECUs or to CAN, MOST or LIN networks. All access will be
	via WebSocket. This allows the server to securely control access to
	vehicle signals.</p>
  
      </section>

      <!-- Message Structure -->
      <section>
	<h3><a>Message</a> Structure</h3>

	<p>Clients can request vehicle signal data from the server by
	sending a JSON data structure to the server via the WebSocket
	connection.</p>

	<p>Only the action, path and requestId attributes are required, however
	multiple other options can be included as described in the table
	below.</p>

	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	  vehicle.send('{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "body.mirrors.left",
	                  "requestId": [some_unique_value] }');
	</pre>

	<pre class="idl">

	<h2><a>Subscribe</a></h2>
	<p>Vehicle data subscriptions provide data to the client whenever the signal changes on the server, unless otherwise specified using Server Side Filtering. The server may reduce the amount of notifications sent to the client in order to reduce processing demands, particularly when the client has subscribed to continuously varying signals.</p>

	<p>When the client makes a request to the server to create a new
	subscription, a JSON data object will be returned. This will contain
	the attributes that were passed to the server to make the
	subscription and a 'subscriptionId' integer handle value which is used to
	uniquely identify the subscription.</p>

      <pre class="idl">

      interface subscribeRequest {

	</pre>
	
	<p>The client can use the 'requestId' value to associate the successful
	subscription response with the original request.</p>
	
	<p>The 'subscriptionId' value is a unique value, created by the server and
	which may be used internally by the server to manage subscriptions
	on that WebSocket instance.</p>

	<p>The subscription id value can be used by the client to
	unsubscribe from receiving future notifications, by passing the
	handle value to the server with the unsubscribe action.</p>
	
	<p>To differentiate subscription response from responses for ‘GET’
	requests, subscription responses will additionally include the
	subscription id value that identifies the subscription that
	triggered that notification.</p>
	
	<p>The server will ensure that a new unique subscription id value is
	returned for each successful subscription request on a particular
	WebSocket connection. However the server does not guarantee that
	subscription handle values are unique between different WebSocket
	instances.</p>

	<pre class="example highlight">

	<h2><a>Unsubscribe</a></h2>
	<p>The client should always unsubscribe from receiving notifications when it is no longer interested in receiving them. Over a long vehicle journey, this will significantly reduce the processing required by the server and enable the server to free memory, making it easier for the server to remain responsive to requests from the client.</p>

	<p>The client sends the unsubscribe action with the ID of the subscription which needs to be unsubscribed. If the client wished to unsubscribe from all of it's clients, it can send a subscription ID of 0. If an invalid ID is sent the server will return an error, as shown in the following examples. Where [nn] denotes a numeric integer error number (e.g. HTTP status code).</p>

	<h3><a>Access</a> Control and Authorization</h3>
	
	<p>When a client makes a request to access signal data it is
	performing the request on behalf of one or more Security Principals
	(that is, for a user a vehicle or a device). It may be that the
	client system does not enable users to login, so the request may be
	from an anonymous user.</p>
	
	<p>Access to signals shall be managed and controlled by the
	server. The server can elect not to enforce access controls on a
	particular signal or set of signals and to enforce different access
	controls on other signals.</p>
	
	<p>Please see the section on Security [TODO add link] for more
	information.</p>

	<p>When a client makes a request for a signal or set of signals that
	are under access control, the request must contain one or more valid
	security tokens (e.g. OAuth 2.0 tokens), one for each Security
	Principal type that the server wishes to authorize. </p>
  
	<p>In addition to the ‘action’ and ‘path’ attributes, a request for
	a resource that is under access control must also contain a
	‘security’ attribute.</p>

	<p>The ‘security’ attribute is a JSON data structure that contains
	one or more name/value pairs, where each name is the name of a valid
	security token and the value is the token value.</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	  "security": { "Authorization": [some_token_value], 
	                "WWW-Vehicle-Device": "[other_token_value]" }
	</pre>
	<p>A subscription request for signals data that is only
	available to suitably authorised Security Principals is shown
	below:</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">

	  vehicle.send('{ "action": "authorization", "token": [some_token_value]');

	  vehicle.send('{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "body.mirrors.left", 
                          "requestId": "[some_unique_value]"');
	</pre>
	<p>[TODO Clarify whether need to specify that token value is
	Base64 encoded]</p>

	<p>For simplicity, many of the subscription examples included
	in this document do not include a security data object. This
	is acceptable if the data that is being accessed is not
	subject to access control restrictions.</p>

      </section>
     
    <section>
      <h3>Server Side <a>Filtering</a></h3>
      <p>A 'Filter' can be specified to enable Server side filtering
      to be used in order to throttle the demands of subscriptions on
      the server. This may enable the reduction of traffic if the
      developer has received a 429 - Too Many Requests error
      message. This can be implementation dependant allowing a number
      of potential filtering mechanisms, such as ranges, intervals and
      minimum changes. This can be implemented using the "filter"
      option.</p>

      <p>The subscription currently defaults to sending values to the
      client only onchange, however this may cause unnecessary
      processing demands on the vehicle server.</p>

      <pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
        { "action": "subscribe", "path": "body.mirrors.left", 
        	"filters": { [insert custom tags]  } }
      </pre>
      <p>Potential tags could include:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Interval - provide data every X ms allowing the developer
	to restrict the number of values received for verbose
	subscriptions</li>
	<li>Range - provide a value only when within a given range</li>
	<li>Minimum change - provide data when a value has changed by
	a specified amount</li>
      </ul>
      <p>[TODO - modify the existing filtering mechanisms]</p>

      <p>If the filter is not set or unsupported the notifcaiton frequency will be
      determined by the server.</p>

      <pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
		//client receives data every 100ms
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "<any_path>", 
        	"filters": { "interval": 100ms },

		//client receives data when the value is between 100 and 200 (inclusive)
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "<any_path>", 
        	"filters": { "range": { "above": 100, "below": 200 } }, 
        	"requestId": "102" }

		//client receives data when the value is below 100 (inclusive)
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "<any_path>", 
        	"filters": { "range": { "below": 100 } }, 
        	"requestId": "102" }

		//client receives data when the value changes by 100 units
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "<any_path>", 
        	"filters": { "minChange": 100 }, 
        	"requestId": "102" }

		//client receives data when the value changes by 100 units
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "<any_path>", 
        	"filters": { "minChange": 100 }, 
        	"requestId": "102" }

		//client receives data when the value is above 200 (inclusive) 
		//and the value changes by 20 units
        { "action": "subscribe", "path": "<any_path>", 
        	"filters": { "range": { "below": 200 }, "minChange": 20}, 
        	"requestId": "102" }
      </pre>      

      <p>When the range filter is used a final message will be sent when the value returned is outside of the specified range. For example, if the the range states { "below": 100 }, a final value may be received at 101 to indicate that the value is now out of range.</p>

      <p>The client should take care to avoid specifying a minimum
		change amount that is too small in order to prevent
		unnecessary messages. The server may provide a TOO_MANY_REQUESTS error if this is the case.</p>

	<h3>Web Socket <a>Closure</a></h3>
	<p>The WebSocket can be closed by either the client or the
	server by invoking the ‘close()’ method on the WebSocket

	<p>The following example shows the lifetime of a WebSocket on
	the client:</p>

// Open the WebSocket

// WebSocket is used to GET, SET, SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE
…

// Close the WebSocket

	<p>The WebSocket server can terminate the WebSocket connection
