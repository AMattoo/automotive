    <!-- Abstract -->
    <section id="abstract">
	<p>The W3C Vehicle Signal Server Specification defines a WebSocket based API that enables
	client applications to get, set, subscribe and unsubscribe to vehicle signals and data.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this specification is to promote a Server API that enables application 
	development in a consistent manner across participating automotive manufacturers.</p>

	<p>It is recommended that this Vehicle Signal Server Specification is read in conjunction with the W3C Vehicle Signal 
	Client Specification and the GENIVI Vehicle Signal Specification.</p>
	
	</p>The Vehicle Signal Client Specification defines an API that wraps the data access and security primitives
	defined in this WebSocket Server Specification. It has been defined to support the development
	of 'standards-compliant' JavaScript libraries that can be used by web based clients.</p> 

	<p>It is assumed that native clients (written for example in C/C++) and managed runtime clients 
	(written in languages like Java or C#) will invoke the WebSocket Server API using standard WebSocket
	libraries that have been created specifically for those languages.</p>

	<p>The GENIVI Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) defines the set of vehicle signals and data that 
	are exposed via this Server Specification. The term 'signal' is used here to represent an item of
	data that can vary over time, for example vehicle speed, whilst the term 'static data' is used to
	denote a temporally unchanging property like vehicle width.</p>

	<p>This Server Specification describes a discovery mechanism that defines the set of signals and data
	that a particular client can access at a particular point in time. It is recognized that some automobile
	manufacturers may expose more signals and data than others. The Vehicle Signal Specification supports both
	extensibility and the ability to define private branches.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, the 'tree' of signals that is accessible at any point in time may also vary depending
	on standard access control principles. That is, it can vary based on the identity of the user (person or
	organisation) requesting the data and/or the device (e.g. vehicle) where the request originates.</p>

	<p>To support this, the Server Specification describes a token based mechanism that can optionally
	be used to pass tokens to the WebSocket Server to represent the user of an application and the device that
	the application is running on.</p>

	<p>The target platform supported by the specification is exclusively passenger vehicles. Use of this 
	specification for non-passenger applications (transportation, heavy machinery, marine, airline 
	infotainment, military, etc.) is not prohibited, but is not covered in the design or content of the
	API and therefore may be insufficient.</p>

	<p>Initially, a typical use case of Vehicle Information might be the implementation of a 'Smart Mechanic'
	application that provides vehicle status information such as tire pressure, engine oil level, washer
	fluid level, battery status, etc. Future use case innovations in transportation, safety, navigation, 
	smart energy grid and consumer infotainment and customization are all possible through this specification.</p>

	<p>Web developers building interoperable applications based upon this API, will help empower a common web platform
	across consumer devices and passenger vehicles consistent with the Web of Things.</p>

    <!-- Status of this document -->
    <section id="sotd">
    </section>
    
    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The vehicle will expose vehicle signals via a WebSocket. This will
      enable a client to GET or SET vehicle signals; to SUBSCRIBE to receive
      notifications relating to one or more vehicle signals and to UNSUBSCRIBE
      from receiving notifications.</p>
      
      <p>A future revision of this specification may consider additionally exposing vehicle signals
      via a RESTful web service but this is out of scope for this version of the specification.</p>
      
      <p>The W3C WebSocket API is defined <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-websockets-20110929">here</a> and 
      the WebSocket Protocol is defined in 
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC6455</a>.</p>
      
      <p>A component or module running on the vehicle is required to open
      a WebSocket connection to enable secure access to vehicle signals. 
      In this specification this module will be referred to as the ‘Application 
      Server’ or for simplicity as ‘the server’.</p>
      
      <p>This specification assumes that a single WebSocket is used to
      enable communication between the client Application and the server
      in order to reduce processing overhead.</p>
      
      <p>N.B It is not explicitly prohibited for the client to request
      that the server opens more than one WebSocket. However, the server
      may refuse to open a subsequent WebSocket connection and the client is
      responsible for handling this gracefully.</p>

      <p>If more than one WebSocket connection is established between a
      client Application and the server then each connection will be
      managed independently. For example, subscriptions created using a
      particular WebSocket connection will only trigger notifications via
      that connection and the client must use that WebSocket instance to
      unsubscribe.</p>

      <p>N.B. If more than one WebSocket connection has been established
      between one or more clients and a particular server instance, there
      is a risk that race conditions and concurrency issues could occur.
      An example of this would be, where two or more WebSocket connections 
      are used to update a particular setting at the same time.</p>
      
      <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the client can only assume
      that the server will implement a simple concurrency model where lost
      updates and dirty reads could potentially occur if the server has
      more than one WebSocket connection open.</p>
      <p>
	An example of use is provided below:</p>

	<pre class="example highlight">
		// open WebSocket
		var vehicle  = new WebSocket("wss://wwwivi", "");

		// establish authorization
		vehicle.onopen = function () {
			vehicle.send({"action": "authorize", "token": "&lt;valid-token&gt;", "requestId": 103});
		};
		
		// request a signal
		if (vehicle.readyState === OPEN) {
			vehicle.send({"action": "get", "path": "signal.public.global.speed"});

			// set message response
			vehicle.onmessage = function(event){
				var msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
				if(msg.path == "signal.public.global.speed" && msg.value){
					console.log("The current speed is " + msg.value);
				}
			};
		}

		// set a subscription
		if (vehicle.readyState === OPEN) {
			vehicle.send({"action": "subscribe", "path": "signal.public.drivetrain.rpm", 
					"requestId": 104});
			vehicle.onmessage = function(event){
				var msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
				if(msg.hasOwnProperty("requestId") && msg.requestId == 104){
					console.log("Latest RPM is " + msg.value);
				}
			};
		}

		// close the WebSocket
		vehicle.close();

      </section>

      <!-- Security and privacy -->
      <section id="security">
        <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The server implementation may optionally restrict access to one or more vehicle signals so that they can only 
	be accessed in response to a request from an authorized user or device. This could be for a variety of 
	reasons, including safety, privacy or commercial concerns.</p>

	<p>Hence, a request to GET, SET, SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE to data may require the client to demonstrate
	to the server that the request is from one or more suitably authorized Security Principals.</p>

        <p>The different types of Security Principal, the approach taken to control access to signals and the importance of data privacy are described in the sections that follow.</p>

        <h3>Security Principals</h3>
	<p>The types of security principal may include:</p>

        <table class="parameters">
	  <tr>
	    <th>Type</th>
	    <th>Description</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>User</td>
	    <td>A person, system or organisation responsible for making the request e.g. driver, Emergency Services, 
	        Smart City Traffic Management System.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Device</td>
	    <td>Vehicle or device where the request originates. Could for example be a user's Consumer Electronics 
		(CE) device connected to the vehicle's WiFi hotspot or another vehicle in a convoy;  an Electronic Control
		Unit (ECU) on the same vehicle or any internet connected system e.g. a Web of Things (WoT) device.</td>
	  </tr>
        </table>

	<h3>Access Control and Authorization</h3>
        <p>When a client makes a request to access signal data it is performing the request on behalf of one or more 
        Security Principals, that is, for a particular user and/or vehicle/device.</p>

        <p>Access to signals will be managed and controlled by the server. The server may elect not to enforce access 
        controls on a particular signal or set of signals and to enforce different access controls on other signals.</p>

        <p>For each security principal that must be authorised by the server, the client will obtain and pass a security token
        e.g. an OAuth 2.0 token (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC6749</a>) to the server using a message
        containing an 'authorize' action (see section TODO).</p>

        <p>A server implementation may require that a request for a particular signal includes a security token for
        both the driver of the vehicle (user) and for the vehicle instance (device). A request for a different set of vehicle signals
        may require that only the user is authorized or that a particular device is authorized to access those vehicle signals.</p>

        <p>After receiving a message with an 'authorize' action the server will attempt to verify the tokens e.g. by checking 
        with the issuing Security Authority. If all of the tokens that are passed to the server are valid, it will return
        a success response and all subsequent requests received by the WebSocket instance will have elevated access control
        privileges. Specifically, each of the GET, SET, SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE actions will have the access control rights
        that the server deems to be appropriate for the security principals represented by the token(s).</p>

        <p>If the client sends a subsequent 'authorize' message to the server with different token value(s). If one or more of these
        are invalid, then the server will return an error response and the WebSocket access control status will remain unchanged. 
        However, if the new token values are valid, then the server will return a success response and the access control 
        privileges associated with the new token(s) only, will apply for all requests from that point.</p>

        <p>If the client or the server close the WebSocket connection and a new WebSocket instance is opened, then it will be
        opened without elevated access control privileges. 
  
        <p>This server specification defines a standarized, token based approach for access control that includes specific error
        reponses for common access control behaviours. The server is free to implement any type of token that is consistent
        with this standardized approach. It is expected that the precise type of security tokens that are supported by a 
        particular server implementation and the format of those tokens will be defined in the server documentation.</p>
      </section>


      <!-- Initialisation of the Web Socket -->
      <section>
	<h3><a>Initialisation</a> of the Web Socket</h3>
	
	<p>If the client application is an HTML Application running in a web
	runtime or is a web page running in a browser, the WebSocket
	instance may either be initialised natively or created using a
	WebSocket standards compliant JavaScript library. A WebSocket
	request can also be initiated from a native (e.g. C++) Application
	or from an Application written using a managed runtime language like
	Java or C#. It is assumed that native and managed clients will use a
	suitable standards compliant WebSocket library to request that a
	WebSocket connection is opened on the server.</p>

	<p>For browser and web runtime clients, the advantage of
	initialising the WebSocket natively in the web runtime is that there
	are fewer overheads for the vehicle signal implementation.</p>
	
	<p>A client running on the vehicle will be able to connect to the
	Application Server instance using the hostname 'wwwivi' and will
	default to port 443. 'wwwivi' would be mapped to 127.0.0.1 in
	etc/hosts file.</p>
	
	<p>The sub-protocol name will always be VISS and with a version
	number suffix, e.g. VISS1.0</p>

	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> vehicle  = new WebSocket("wss://wwwivi", "<sub-protocol>");
	</pre>
	
	<p>RESTful web services are out of scope for the first revision of
	this specification, but could be considered for addition in a later
	version.</p>
	
	<p>There is little advantage to embedding this in a Vehicle object
	on the navigator interface.</p>

	<p>To support ‘defence in depth’ and a layered security approach,
	connections between clients and servers will be strongly
	encrypted. This is to make it more difficult for an attacker that
	has succeeded in installing malicious code on a vehicle to
	eavesdrop, hijack security tokens and impersonate valid security
	principals to get and set sensitive vehicle signals.</p>
	
	<p>The client will connect to the server over HTTPS and request that
	the server opens a WebSocket. All WebSocket communications between
	the client and server will therefore be over ‘wss’.</p>
	
	<p>Non encrypted communication will not be supported, hence the
	server will refuse ‘ws’ connection requests.</p>

	<p>In many vehicle designs, vehicle signals are made available by
	Electronic Control Units (ECUs) connected via internal vehicle
	networks. These include Controller Area Networks (CAN), Media
	Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) and Local Interconnect Networks
	(LIN). For security reasons, clients will not be able to connect
	directly to ECUs or to CAN, MOST or LIN networks. All access will be
	via WebSocket. This allows the server to securely control access to
	vehicle signals.</p>
  
      </section>

      <!-- Message Structure -->
      <section>
	<h3><a>Message</a> Structure</h3>

	<p>Clients can request vehicle signal data from the server by
	sending a JSON data structure to the server via the WebSocket
	connection.</p>

	<p>Only the action, path and requestId attributes are required, however
	multiple other options may be included as described in the table
	below.</p>

	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	  vehicle.send('{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "body.mirrors.left",
	                  "requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }');
	</pre>

	<pre class="idl">

	<h4><a>Path</a></h4>
	<p>This is the desired vehicle signal(s) path, as defined by the <a

	Signal Specification (VSS)</a></p>

	<h2><a>Authorize</a></h2>
 	<p>To enable access to signals that are under access control, the client can optionally pass a message with an
         'authorize' action to the server. The structure of the message and the associated success and error responses
         are defined below.</p>
      <pre class="idl">
      interface authorizationRequest

      </pre>

    <p>The 'tokens' JSON fragment may contain just an 'authorization' name/value pair to pass only 
        the user token or just a 'www-vehicle-device' pair to pass the only the vehicle token or it may include both 
        name/value pairs as illustrated below:</p>

        vehicle.send('{ "action": "authorize", 
                        "tokens": { "www-vehicle-device": "&lt;device_token_value&gt;" },

	<h2><a>Subscribe</a></h2>
	<p>Vehicle data subscriptions provide data to the client whenever the signal changes on the server, unless otherwise specified using Server Side Filtering. The server may reduce the amount of notifications sent to the client in order to reduce processing demands, particularly when the client has subscribed to continuously varying signals.</p>

	<p>When the client makes a request to the server to create a new
	subscription, a JSON data object will be returned. This will contain
	the attributes that were passed to the server to make the
	subscription and a 'subscriptionId' integer handle value which is used to
	uniquely identify the subscription.</p>

      <pre class="idl">

      interface subscribeRequest {
        attribute Action action;
        attribute DOMString path;
        attribute object? filters;

	}
	
	receive <- { 
		"subscriptionId": 35472, 
		"requestId":"&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" 
	}
	</pre>
	<p>The client can use the 'requestId' value to associate the successful
	subscription response with the original request.</p>
	
	<p>The 'subscriptionId' value is a unique value, created by the server and
	which will be used internally by the server to manage subscriptions
	on that WebSocket instance.</p>

	<p>The subscription id value may be used by the client to
	unsubscribe from receiving future notifications, by passing the
	handle value to the server with the unsubscribe action.</p>
	
	<p>To differentiate subscription response from responses for ‘GET’
	requests, subscription responses shall additionally include the
	subscription id value that identifies the subscription that
	triggered that notification.</p>
	
	<p>The server will ensure that a new unique subscription id value is
	returned for each successful subscription request on a particular
	WebSocket connection. However the server does not guarantee that
	subscription handle values are unique between different WebSocket
	instances.</p>

	<pre class="example highlight">
	</pre>

	<h2><a>Unsubscribe</a></h2>
	<p>The client should always unsubscribe from receiving notifications when it is no longer interested in receiving them. Over a long vehicle journey, this will significantly reduce the processing required by the server and enable the server to free memory, making it easier for the server to remain responsive to requests from the client.</p>

	<p>The client sends the unsubscribe action with the ID of the subscription which needs to be unsubscribed. If the client wished to unsubscribe from all of it's clients, it can send a subscription ID of 0. If an invalid ID is sent the server will return an error, as shown in the following examples. Where [nn] denotes a numeric integer error number (e.g. HTTP status code).</p>

      <pre class="idl">
      interface unsubscribeRequest {
        attribute Action action;

      <h3>Server Side <a>Filtering</a></h3>
      <p>A 'Filter' may be specified to enable Server side filtering
      to be used in order to throttle the demands of subscriptions on
      the server. This may enable the reduction of traffic if the
      developer has received a 429 - Too Many Requests error
      message. This can be implementation dependant allowing a number
      of potential filtering mechanisms, such as ranges, intervals and
      minimum changes. This can be implemented using the "filters"
      option.</p>

      <p>The subscription currently defaults to sending values to the
      client only onchange, however this may cause unnecessary
      processing demands on the vehicle server.</p>

      <pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
        { "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;", 
        	"filters": { &lt;insert custom tags&lt;  } }
      </pre>
      <p>Potential tags could include:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Interval - provide data every X ms allowing the developer
	to restrict the number of values received for verbose
	subscriptions</li>
	<li>Range - provide a value only when within a given range</li>
	<li>Minimum change - provide data when a value has changed by
	a specified amount</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the filter is not set or unsupported the notifcaiton frequency will be
      determined by the server.</p>

      <pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
	//client receives data every 100ms
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;", 
        	"filters": { "interval": 100 }, 
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }

	//client receives data when the value is between 100 and 200 (inclusive)
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;", 
        	"filters": { "range": { "above": 100, "below": 200 } }, 
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }

	//client receives data when the value is below 100 (inclusive)
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;", 
        	"filters": { "range": { "below": 100 } }, 
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }

	//client receives data when the value changes by 100 units
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;", 
        	"filters": { "minChange": 100 }, 
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }

	//client receives data when the value changes by 100 units
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;", 
        	"filters": { "minChange": 100 }, 
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }

	//client receives data when the value is above 200 (inclusive) 
	//and the value changes by 20 units
	{ "action": "subscribe", "path": "&lt;any_path&gt;", 
        	"filters": { "range": { "below": 200 }, "minChange": 20}, 
        	"requestId": "&lt;some_unique_value&gt;" }
      </pre>      

      <p>When the range filter is used a final message will be sent when the value returned is outside 
      of the specified range. For example, if the the range states { "below": 100 }, a final value may 
      be received at 101 to indicate that the value is now out of range.</p>

      <p>The client should take care to avoid specifying a minimum
		change amount that is too small in order to prevent
		unnecessary messages. The server may provide a 429 - Too Many Request error if this is the case.</p>

      <section>
	<h3><a>Errors</a></h3>

        <p>For some error codes, for example '401 (Unauthorised)' there can be more than one cause. 
        The error number that is returned will be the HTTP Status Code Number e.g. 401. 
        An error reason will also be returned, this will contain a pre-defined string value that
        can be used to distinguish between errors that have the same code (e.g. '401 Unauthorized)' but a difference cause.
        The error message will be used to provide message text describing the cause in more detail.</p>

    <p>The server may optionally return additional error codes. It is expected that if this is the case, they will be defined in the Server Documentation.
         Wherever possible the Server will return a standard HTTP error code where one has been defined for the error condition. 
       See for example <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231">RFC7231</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235">RFC7235</a>,  
        and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585">RFC6585</a>.</p>

	<h3>Web Socket <a>Closure</a></h3>
	<p>The WebSocket may be closed by either the client or the
	server by invoking the ‘close()’ method on the WebSocket
	instance.</p>

	<p>The following example shows the lifetime of a WebSocket on
	the client:</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
// Open the WebSocket
var vehicle  = new WebSocket(“wss://localhost:4343”);

// WebSocket is used to GET, SET, SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE
…

// Close the WebSocket
vehicle.close();
	</pre>
	<p>The WebSocket server may terminate the WebSocket connection
	if it has not received a request for a period determined by
	the server. It is the client’s responsibility to handle this
	gracefully and to recover and for example request new
	subscriptions, where these are required.</p>

	<h3><a>Dataflow</a> Examples - For Editors' Reference. To be removed</h3>
	<h4>Subscribe</h4>
	<p>Subscribe to an attribute at 100ms interval</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> '{ "action": "subscribe", “interval”: 100, "path": "body.trunk" }'
//confirm subscription
receive <- '{ "id": 13654, "interval": 100, "path": "body.trunk" }
//return data every 100ms
receive <- '{ "id" 13654, "path": "body.trunk", 
              "value": { "isopen": true, "islocked": false } }
receive <- '{ "id" 13654, "path": "body.trunk", 
              "value": { "isopen": true, "islocked": false } }
receive <- '{ "id": 13654, "path": "body.trunk", 
              "value": { "isopen": true, "islocked": false } }
	</pre>
	<p>Subscribe to an attribute onchange (discrete values
	therefore no threshold required). The server returns only the
	changed attribute.</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> '{ "action": "subscribe", “onchange”: true, "path": "body.trunk" }'
//confirm subscription
receive <- '{ "id": 13658, "onchange": true, "path": "body.trunk" }
//return data when the trunk is opened
receive <- '{ "id": 13658, "path": "body.trunk", "value": { "isopen": true, "islocked": false } }
//return data when the trunk is closed
receive <- '{ "id": 13658, "path": "body.trunk", "value": { "isopen": false, "islocked": false } }
//return data when the trunk is locked
receive <- '{ "id": 13658, "path": "body.trunk", "value": { "isopen": false, "islocked": true }}
	</pre>
	<p>Subscribe to an attribute (tps - throttle position) onchange
	(continuous value without minChange, so minChange determined by the
	server).</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> { "action": "subscribe", "onchange": true, "path": "engine.tps" }}
receive <- '{ "id": 13661, "path": "engine.tps", "value": 54}'
receive <- '{ "id": 13661, "path": "engine.tps", "value": 58}'
	</pre>
	<p>Subscribe to an attribute (tps - throttle position)
	onchange (continuous value with minChange and bounds set).</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> { "action": "subscribe", "onchange": { "above": 60, "below": 100, "minChange": 20 }, "path": "engine.tps" }}
receive <- '{ "id": 13662, "path": "engine.tps", "value": 60}'
receive <- '{ "id": 13662, "path": "engine.tps", "value": 80}'
	</pre>
	<h4>Unsubscribe</h4>

	<p>Unsubscribe from a single subscription with valid ID</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> '{ "action": "unsubscribe", "id": 35472 }'
receive <- '{ "status": "success", "action": "unsubscribe", "id": 35472}
	</pre>
	<p>Unsubscribe from all subscriptions by sending subscription
	“id” of ‘0’</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> '{ "action": "unsubscribe", “id”: 0 }'
receive <- '{ "status": "success", "action": "unsubscribe", "id": 0 }
	</pre>
	<p>Unsubscribe from a single subscription with an invalid ID</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> '{ "action": "unsubscribe", “id”: 3542 }'
receive <- '{ "error": { "number":[nn], "code": INVALID_ID ,"message": "Invalid ID" }, "action": "unsubscribe", “id”: 3542 }
         </pre>

	 <p>Where [nn] denotes a numeric integer error number (e.g. HTTP status code).</p>

	 <p>The client should always unsubscribe from receiving notifications when
	 it is no longer interested in receiving them. Over a long vehicle
	 journey, this will significantly reduce the processing required by the
	 server and enable the server to free memory, making it easier for the
	 server to remain responsive to requests from the client.</p>

	 <h4>Get</h4>

	 <p>The server shall return messages to the client using the
	 following format, including the path to the signal and the
	 value held within the signal:</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> { "action": "get", "path": "engine.rpm" }
receive <- { "path": "engine.rpm", "value": 2372 }
	</pre>
	<p>In the case where the client has subscribed to a path which
	returns a complex type, the value shall be returned as name
	value pairs in a JSON object, as defined in the vehicle signal
	specification format. Wildcards may be used in order to
	specify only a subset of data. This can be specified at any
	level of the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) tree.</p>

	<p>Complex type</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> { "action": "get", "path": "body.trunk" }
receive <- { "path": "body.trunk", "value": { "locked": false, "open": true }}
	</pre>
	<p>Complex type with nested array. Path: “body.doors.*.lock” -
	All doors, lock state.</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> { "action": "get", "path": " body.doors.*.lock" }
receive <- { "path": "body.doors.*.lock ", "value": { [ {"locked" : true }, {"locked" : true }, 
              {"locked" : false }, {"locked" : true } ] } }
	</pre>
	<p>Complex type with nested array. Path: “body.doors.*” - All
	doors, all door attributes (where door has two attributes,
	lock and window_pos)</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> { "action": "get", "path": " body.doors.* " }
receive <- { "path": "body.doors.*.lock ", "value": { [ {“locked” : true, “windows_pos”: 143 }, {“locked” : true, “windows_pos”: 23 },
              {“locked” : false, “windows_pos”: 162 }, {“locked” : true, “windows_pos”: 0 } ] }
	</pre>
	<p>Request none-existent data</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> { "action": "get", "path": "body.flux.capacitor" }
receive <- '{ "error": { "number":[nn], "code": UNRECOGNISED_FORMAT, "message": "Unrecognised Format" } }
	</pre>
	<h4>Set</h4>
	<p>Successfully set a signal.</p>
	<pre class="highlight hljs javascript">
client -> { "action": "set", "path": " body.doors.*.lock", "value":{ [ {“locked” : true }, {“locked” : true },
